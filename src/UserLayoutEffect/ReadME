useLayoutEffect is similar to useEffect, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations and before the browser performs the paint phase. 
It is useful when you need to read or interact with the DOM immediately after changes have been made but before the changes are visible to the user.
 The primary use case for useLayoutEffect is to ensure that certain actions or calculations that depend on the DOM layout are performed synchronously 
 and without causing flickering or visual artifacts.
